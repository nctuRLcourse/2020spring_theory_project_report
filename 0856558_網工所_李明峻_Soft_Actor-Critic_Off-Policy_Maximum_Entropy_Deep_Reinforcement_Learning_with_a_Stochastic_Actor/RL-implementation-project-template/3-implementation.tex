\section{Detailed Implementation}
\label{section:implementation}
Please explain your implementation in detail. You may do this with the help of pseudo code or a figure of system architecture. Please also highlight which parts of the algorithm lead to the most difficulty in your implementation.


q_\pi(s, a) = r(s, a) + \gamma\sum_{s'\inS}P_{ss'}^a\sum\pi(a'|s')q_\pi(s', a')

seeing entropy as one part of the reward.
